Welcome !

Hello! I'm Gabriel Coelho, a seasoned Solutions Engineer, Tech Lead, and Project Manager with a strong background in developing B2G data intelligence solutions. I lead teams usually of over five people and am responsible for designing the on-demand inference architecture for the NVIDIA "Mandu" cluster in the state of Piau√≠. I believe in impact-driven development, focusing on projects that make a positive difference.

Professionally, I am adept at utilizing various technology stacks depending on the solution being developed. My teams and I frequently use Python, Go, JavaScript, FastAPI, RabbitMQ, NextJS, Keycloak, Docker, Open-Source LLMs, and traditional Machine Learning, among other technologies.

I invite you to explore my public projects here, which include both personal, professional endeavors and a lot of drafts. For more information, feel free to visit my website: https://inovadata.tech/.
